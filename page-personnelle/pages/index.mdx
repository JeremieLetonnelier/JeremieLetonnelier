    ## Hey there!

I'm a curious and meticulous Data Engineer with a passion for unraveling the complexities of data. 
I thrive on the thrill of learning new things and tackling challenges head-on. Not to brag, but admitting when I don't know something is my superpower – it keeps me on my toes and ensures I'm always growing.

When it comes to data, I'm your go-to person. I can seamlessly develop ETL processes, wrangle both attribute and geometric data like a pro, and architect robust databases that stand the test of time. 
Oh, and did I mention I'm a wizard at crafting web applications, APIs, and dashboards? Git and CI/CD processes are also part of my capabilites.

But I'm not just a tech geek – I bring a dash of zest to the table. I'm an avid cyclist (roadie one) and trail runner, channeling that same determination from the data world into the great outdoors. 
Whether it's navigating complex data landscapes or conquering rugged trails, I thrive on the challenge.

You'll always find me with a smile on my face and a positive attitude. My professional journey has shown that my presence injects dynamism into teams, creating an environment where collaboration and innovation flourish.

Let's chat – I'm not just looking for projects; I'm eager to embark on data adventures, turning challenges into triumphs. Ready to make some data magic together?

Cheers,
Jérémie
